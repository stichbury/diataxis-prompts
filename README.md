## Tutorial Prompt

Rewrite this text as a **tutorial** for someone learning this software for the first time. Use "we" language throughout ("In this tutorial, we will..."). Transform any abstract concepts into concrete, hands-on steps that the learner will actually perform. Start each instruction with action words ("First, do X. Now, do Y."). Include expected outputs after each step ("The output should look something like..."). Remove any explanations of why things work - replace with minimal context ("We use HTTPS because it's more secure") and link to detailed explanations elsewhere. Focus on creating a single, linear path to a meaningful accomplishment. Eliminate all options, alternatives, and choices - show only one way to succeed. Make every step produce a visible, comprehensible result.

## How-to Guide Prompt

Rewrite this text as a **how-to guide** for a competent user who has a specific problem to solve. Use "you" language and conditional imperatives ("If you want X, do Y"). Start by clearly stating what problem this guide solves ("This guide shows you how to..."). Focus entirely on the practical steps needed to achieve the goal - remove any teaching or background explanation. Structure the content around the user's workflow, not the tool's features. Address real-world complexity by showing how to adapt the guidance to different situations. Cut any unnecessary completeness - start and end at reasonable points, assuming the user can connect this to their broader work. Eliminate any reference to learning or skill-building - this is about getting work done efficiently.

## Reference Prompt

Rewrite this text as **reference material** that provides neutral, factual information. Remove all personal pronouns and instructional language. Present information in a structured, systematic way that mirrors how the software itself is organized. State facts about what the software does, not how to use it ("X function accepts Y parameters and returns Z"). List all options, parameters, commands, and features comprehensively. Include warnings where appropriate ("You must use A. Never do B."). Remove all opinions, explanations of why, and subjective judgments. Make the content austere and authoritative - something a user would quickly consult to check a specific fact, not read through. Organize information so users can find exactly what they need without reading everything else.

## Explanation Prompt

Rewrite this text as **explanatory material** that helps users understand the bigger picture. Use a discursive, conversational tone that can include opinions and perspectives ("W is better than Z because..."). Focus on answering "why" questions and making connections between concepts. Provide historical context, design decisions, and rationale ("The reason for X is because historically..."). Compare alternatives and discuss trade-offs ("Some users prefer W. This can be a good approach, but..."). Make connections to related concepts and external ideas. Structure the content around topics and themes rather than step-by-step procedures. Include context that helps readers understand not just what the software does, but why it works that way and how it fits into broader patterns. This should be content someone might read away from their computer to deepen their understanding.
